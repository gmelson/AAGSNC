	<p>Weekend Coffee Roasters (WCR) has three dedicated, meticulous, passionate coffee roasters.  While they all share the same dedication and commitment to roasting great coffee, their passion for coffee and roasting developed in different ways.
            Please meet our roasters.</p>

	<p>1.  Many coffee roasters are passionate about coffee, and fell in love with the aroma before ever trying it.  What is your first coffee memory?  When did you take your first sip?</p>

        <p>Greg</p>
        First coffee memory, coffee candy, delicious.  Started drinking bad coffee at work.  I would mix a cup of coffee with powdered hot chocalate.
        <p>Brandon</p>
        My first memory was my parents morning brews with the percolator. Not good coffee. My first cup didn't happen until I was 17 and it was folgers. Of course I felt grown up. But I didn't start appreciating coffee until Starbucks became the mainstream standard.
        
        
        You've been roasting for over four years, and are currently transitioning from your current career to full-time roaster.  Why did decide to start roasting coffee company and roast professionally?
	<p>Greg</p>
        I'm transitioning out of tech to do something I am passionate about, roasting and drinking coffee.
        <p>Brandon</p>
        I'm an engineer but now I mostly manage projects. I tried many others roast and thought "I can do that". When I got a home roaster I knew I could do better, and enjoy sharing it with others.
        <p>Don</p>
        I'm currently transitioning from Property Administrator to full-time roaster.  Frequenting various coffee chains throughout the years with friends and getting coffee that often times was burnt or left out too long convinced me to try to roast my own beans. 
           After talking with other people and coffee enthuses in the bay area and finding that they would love to brew their own from freshly roasted beans...I simply just wanted to offer the consumer a alternative choice and a assortment of high quality whole roasted beans.
        3.  What makes Weekend coffee great?
	<p>Greg</p>
        Me! That was too easy!
        <p>Brandon</p>
        3. The people. We make great coffee but many shops in Northern California do. We love coffee and we love meeting, helping and teaching people about this amazing drink.
        
	Our roasters share a love of coffee and it's reflected in our roasts.  Their goal is to create a wonderful roast that will produce a perfect cup of coffee that people will enjoy as much as they do.
